# Summary

This roadmap is designed to provide a university-level foundation in **European Studies**, an interdisciplinary field combining history, politics, culture, economics, languages, and international relations with a focus on Europe and the European Union.

The structure follows a logical progression: building foundational knowledge, developing core interdisciplinary understanding, pursuing specialization, and synthesizing through a capstone project. Language study runs parallel throughout, as proficiency in at least one modern European language (beyond English) is essential for authentic engagement with sources and perspectives.

- **Intro**: Basic orientation to Europe as a historical, cultural, and political entity.
- **Core**: Solid grasp of Europe's modern development and the EU's role.
- **Advanced**: Specialized depth in a chosen track.
- **Capstone**: Demonstration of integrated knowledge through independent research.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

# Curriculum

## Parallel Requirement: European Language Proficiency

Study one modern European language (e.g., French, German, Spanish, Italian, or another relevant one) progressively throughout the program. Aim for intermediate to advanced proficiency (equivalent to B1–B2 level). This enables reading primary sources and cultural materials in the original.
