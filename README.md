# Summary

This roadmap is designed to provide a university-level foundation in **European Studies**, an interdisciplinary field combining history, politics, culture, economics, languages, and international relations with a focus on Europe and the European Union.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to use this curriculum

Study these sections in this order:

**I. Foundations of European Studies**: Start here. This section gives you the basic conceptual tools, vocabulary, and geographic framework you need before anything else.

**II. Historical Foundations of Europe (Chronological Core)**: Move to this section next. It builds the timeline and major turning points that explain why Europe is the way it is today. Almost everything else in the curriculum refers back to this history.

**III. European Politics and Governance**: Study this third. It shows how modern European societies organize power, make decisions, and cooperate (especially through the European Union). This section ties the history to the present-day political reality.

**IV. European Economies and Political Economy**: Money, markets, economic crises, the euro, or how economic forces shape European politics and society. 

**V. European Cultures, Ideas, and Society**: Art, literature, philosophy, identity, migration, media, or the everyday cultural life of Europeans. 

## European Language Proficiency

Continuous study of **one modern European language** (French, German, Spanish, Italian, etc.), progressing from beginner to advanced (CEFR A1 → B2/C1). This runs alongside all stages.
